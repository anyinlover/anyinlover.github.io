## Why learn Data Mining
I have to admit that I know nothing about data mining. But it's the nesessary process in the data science. The occupation need it, the data contest need it. So I'm here.

## Which material do I choose
I search in zhihu and read some other blogs and several person recommend the <<Date Mining: Concepts and Techniques>> by Jiawei Han. It has updated to third edition and after reading the preface and chap1, I really believe it is what I want.

## Which chaps will I learn
I'm in a DataCastle contest, and need to know classification urgently. So I will just pick these chaps to learn first.
* chap1 - Introduction
* chap2 - Getting to Know your Data
* Chap8 - Classification: Basic Concepts
* Chap9 - Classification: Advanced Methods

## How long to take
I plan to briefly read the chaps in this week, and take another week to practice with R or python.
