- Be Careful With rm!
- A useful tip: use ls before rm

### In - Create Links

Create a hard link

    ln file link

Create a symbolic link

    ln -s item link

## Hard Links

Two limitations:

1. Cannot reference a file outside its own file system
2. Cannot reference a directory

Hard Link file has the same inode as the file, `-i`option can reveal inode information

    ls -li

### Symbolic Links

Broken link: The file is deleted before the symbolic link
