Occasionally, users encounter difficulties when attempting to send EPUB files to their Kindle devices using Amazon's "Send to Kindle" service. The underlying causes for these conversion failures remain elusive, presenting a challenge for consistent troubleshooting.

However, a practical workaround often proves effective:

**Intermediate AZW3 Conversion:**

* Convert the problematic EPUB file to the AZW3 format, which is a Kindle-native format.
* Subsequently, convert the AZW3 file back to EPUB.

This two-step conversion process can effectively address certain compatibility issues that may be hindering the initial "Send to Kindle" conversion. By introducing this intermediate format, the file undergoes a re-processing that often resolves underlying formatting or encoding conflicts.

While this workaround is frequently successful, it's important to note that the specific reasons for the original conversion failures can vary. Amazon's conversion algorithms and the inherent complexities of EPUB formatting contribute to this variability.
