# Courses Intro

Here is a series of courses that adapt from various textbooks or online tutorials under creative commons licenses. LLMs help us to learn quicker, but I believe we still need a systematic approach to learning.

If there are any issues or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anyinlover/anyinlover.github.io).

I hope you enjoy these courses!
