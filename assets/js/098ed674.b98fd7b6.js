The branch instruction can be conditional or unconditional. An ",(0,r.jsx)(t.em,{children:"unconditional branch"})," instruction does a branch to the specified address irrespective of any condition. A ",(0,r.jsx)(t.em,{children:"conditional branch"})," instruction causes a branch only if a specified condition is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied, the PC is incremented in the normal way, and the next instruction in sequential address order is fetched and executed. In the example above, the instruction Branch*>*0 LOOP (branch if greater than 0) is a conditional branch instruction that causes a branch to location LOOP if the result of the immediately preceding instruction, which is the decremented value in register R1, is greater than zero. This means that the loop is repeated as long as there are entries in the list that are yet to be added to R0. At\xa0the end of the ",(0,r.jsx)(t.em,{children:"n"}),"th pass through the loop, the Decrement instruction produces a value of zero, and, hence, branching does not occur. Instead, the Move instruction is fetched and executed. It moves the final result from R0 into memory location SUM. Some ISAs refer to such instructions as ",(0,r.jsx)(t.em,{children:"Jumps"}),". The processor keeps track of information about the results of various operations for use by subsequent conditional branch instructions. This is accomplished by recording the required information in individual bits, often called ",(0,r.jsx)(t.em,{children:"condition code flags"}),". These flags are usually grouped together in a special processor register called the ",(0,r.jsx)(t.em,{children:"condition code register"})," or ",(0,r.jsx)(t.em,{children:"status register"}),". Individual condition code flags are set to 1 or cleared to 0, depending on the outcome of the operation performed. Some of the commonly used flags are: Sign, Zero, Overflow and Carry. The call and return instructions are used in conjunction with subroutines. A subroutine is a self-contained sequence of instructions that performs a given computational task. During the execution of a program, a subroutine may be called to perform its function many times at various points in the main program. Each time a subroutine is called, a branch is executed to the beginning of the subroutine to start executing its set of instructions. After the subroutine has been executed, a branch is made back to the main program, through the return instruction. Interrupts can also change the flow of a program. A program interrupt refers to the transfer of program control from a currently running program to another service program as a result of an external or internally generated request. Control returns to the original program after the service program is executed. The interrupt procedure is, in principle, quite similar to a subroutine call except for three variations: (1) The interrupt is usually initiated by an internal or external signal apart from the execution of an instruction (2) the address of the interrupt service program is determined by the hardware or from some information from the interrupt signal or the instruction causing the interrupt; and (3) an interrupt procedure usually stores all the information necessary to define the state of the CPU rather than storing only the program counter. Therefore, when the processor is interrupted, it saves the current status of the processor, including the return address, the register contents and the status information called the Processor Status Word (PSW), and then jumps to the interrupt handler or the interrupt service routine. Upon completing this, it returns to the main program.

Also, observe that, based on the number of operands that are supported and the size of the various fields, the length of the instructions will vary. Some processors fit all the instructions into a single sized format, whereas others make use of formats of varying sizes.

Memories are normally arranged as bytes and a unique address of a memory location is capable of storing 8 bits of information. But when you look at the word length of the processor, the word length of the processor may be more than one byte. Suppose you look at a 32-bit processor, it is made up of four bytes. These four bytes span over four memory locations. When you specify the address of a word how you would specify the address of the word \u2013 are you going to specify the address of the most significant byte as the address of the word (big end) or specify the address of the least significant byte (little end) as the address of the word. That distinguishes between a big endian arrangement and a little endian arrangement. IBM, Motorola, HP follow the big endian arrangement and Intel follows the little endian arrangement. Also, when a data spans over different memory locations, and if you try to access a word which is aligned with the word boundary, we say there is an alignment. If you try to access the words not starting at a word boundary, you can still access, but they are not aligned. Whether there is support to access data that is misaligned is a design issue. Even if you\u2019re allowed to access data that is misaligned, it normally takes more number of memory cycles to access the data."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Finally looking at the role of compilers the compiler has a lot of role to play when you\u2019re defining the instruction set architecture.
