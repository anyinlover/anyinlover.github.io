The thread-select logic uses information from various pipeline stages to decide when to select or deselect a thread. For example, the thread-select stage can determine instruction type using a predecode bit in the instruction cache, while some traps are only detectable in later pipeline stages.

Even though the L1 caches are small, they significantly reduce the average memory access time per thread with miss rates in the range of 10 percent.

The L2 cache also interleaves data across banks at a 64-byte granularity. A load that missed in an L1 cache (load miss) is delivered to the source bank of the L2 cache along with its replacement way from the L1 cache. There, the load miss address is entered in the corresponding L1 tag location of the directory, the L2 cache is accessed to get the missing line and data is then returned to the L1 cache. The directory thus maintains a sharers list at L1-line granularity. A subsequent store from a different or same L1 cache will look up the directory and queue up invalidates to the L1 caches that have the line. Stores do not update the local caches until they have updated the L2 cache. During this time, the store can pass data to the same thread but not to other threads; therefore, a store attains global visibility in the L2 cache. The crossbar establishes memory order between transactions from the same and different L2 banks, and guarantees delivery of transactions to L1 caches in the same order.
