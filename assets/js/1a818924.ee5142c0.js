The load / store memory-reference instructions use the ALU for effective address calculation, the arithmetic and logical instructions for the operation execution, and branches for condition evaluation, which is comparison here. As we can see, the simplicity and regularity of the instruction set simplifies the implementation by making the execution of many of the instruction classes similar. After using the ALU, the actions required to complete various instruction classes differ. A memory-reference instruction will need to access the memory. For a load instruction, a memory read has to be performed. For a store instruction, a memory write has to be performed. An arithmetic/logical instruction must write the data from the ALU back into a register. A load instruction also has to write the data fetched form memory to a register. Lastly, for a branch instruction, we may need to change the next instruction address based on the comparison. If the condition of comparison fails, the PC should be incremented by 4 to get the address of the next instruction. If the condition is true, the new address will have to updated in the PC.

In addition to computing the branch target address, we must also determine whether the next instruction is the instruction that follows sequentially or the instruction at the branch target address. This depends on the condition being evaluated. When the condition is true (i.e., the operands are equal), the branch target address becomes the new PC, and we say that the branch is taken.

This microprogram is stored in a specific location and execution of each instruction starts from that memory location. At the end of the fetch microprogram, the starting address generator unit calculates the appropriate starting address of the microprogram for the instruction which is currently present in IR.
