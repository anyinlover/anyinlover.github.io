With the average dynamic branch frequency of 15% to 25%, we normally have only 4 to 7 instructions executing between a pair of branches. Additionally, the instructions in the basic block are likely to depend on each other. So, the basic block does not offer too much scope for exploiting ILP. In order to obtain substantial performance enhancements, we must exploit ILP across multiple basic blocks. The simplest method to exploit parallelism is to explore loop-level parallelism, to exploit parallelism among iterations of a loop.

So, the reservation station fetches and buffers an operand as soon as it becomes available (not necessarily involving register file). This helps in avoiding WAR hazards. If an operand is not available, it stores information about the instruction that supplies the operand. The renaming is done through the mapping between the registers and the reservation stations. When a functional unit finishes its operation, the result is broadcast on a result bus, called the common data bus (CDB). This value is written to the appropriate register and also the reservation station waiting for that data. When two instructions are to modify the same register, only the last output updates the register file, thus handling WAW hazards.

A basic block is a straight-line code sequence with no branches in, except to the entry, and no branches out, except at the exit. With the average dynamic branch frequency of 15% to 25%, we normally have only 4 to 7 instructions executing between a pair of branches. Additionally, the instructions in the basic block are likely to depend on each other. So, the basic block does not offer too much scope for exploiting ILP. In order to obtain substantial performance enhancements, we must exploit ILP across multiple basic blocks. The simplest method to exploit parallelism is to explore loop-level parallelism, to exploit parallelism among iterations of a loop. Vector architectures are one way of handling loop level parallelism. Otherwise, we will have to look at either dynamic or static methods of exploiting loop level parallelism.

The only difficulties that arise are when the integer instruction is a floating-point load, store, or move. This possibility creates contention for the floating-point register ports and may also create a new RAW hazard when the second instruction of the pair depends on the first.

VLIW architectures obviously have larger code size. The estimates of IA-64 code is up to 2X \u2013 4X over x86. This will lead to increase in instruction bandwidth requirements and decrease in instruction cache effectiveness. They also require a more complex compiler. Superscalars can more efficiently execute pipeline-independent code.

We have discussed the VLIW style of multiple issue processors. VLIW processors form instruction bundles consisting of a number of instructions and the bundles are issued statically. Hazard detection and issue are done by the compiler. The compiler has to be complicated and uses different techniques for exploiting ILP. Early VLIWs were quite rigid in their instruction formats and effectively required recompilation of programs for different versions of the hardware. To reduce this inflexibility and enhance performance of the approach, several innovations have been incorporated into more recent architectures of this type. This second generation of VLIW architectures is the approach being pursued for desktop and server markets.
