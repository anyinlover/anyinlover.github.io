Since no other processor uses the data, the program behavior is identical to that in a uniprocessor. Similarly, when shared data are cached, the shared value may be replicated in multiple caches. In addition to the reduction in access latency and required memory bandwidth, this replication also provides a reduction in contention that may exist for shared data items that are being read by multiple processors simultaneously. Caching of shared data, however, introduces the ",(0,i.jsx)(t.em,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"cache coherence"})})," problem.

The complexity of implementing these capabilities is likely to mean sacrifices in the maximum clock rate.
