## Applications Of Text

### Documents

### Web pages

### Email

### Printer Output

### Program Source Code

## Revisiting Some Old Friends

### cat

`cat > foo.txt`

To display all characters:

`cat -A foo.txt`

- MS-DOS Text Vs. Unix Text
  hidden carriage returns
  dos2unix and unix2dos

-n numbers lines and -s suppress the output of multiple blank lines.

`cat -ns foo.txt`

### sort

`sort > foo.txt`

`sort file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > final_sorted_list.txt`

Common sort Options

| Option | Description                                                                          |
| :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   -b   | Ignore leading spaces in lines                                                       |
|   -f   | Makes sorting case-insensitive                                                       |
|   -n   | Performs sorting based on the numeric evaluation of a string                         |
|   -r   | Sorting in reverse order                                                             |
|   -k   | Sort based on a key field loccated from field1 to field2 rather than the entire line |
|   -m   | Treat each argument as the name of a presorted file                                  |
|   -o   | Send sorted output to file rather than standard output                               |
|   -t   | Define the field-separator character                                                 |

`du -s /usr/share/* | head`

The du command lists the results of a summary in pathname order

`du -s /usr/share/* | sort -nr | head`

Sort on a specified field

`ls -l /usr/bin | sort -nr -k 5 | head`

Sort on multiple keys

`sort -k 1, 1 -k 2n distros.txt`

The key option allows specification of offsets within fields

`sort -k 3.7nbr -k 3.1nbr -k 3.4nbr distros.txt`

Define the field separator character

`sort -t ':' -k 7 /etc/passwd | head`

### uniq

Remove any duplicate lines in a sorted file. Often used in conjunction with sort.

`sort foo.txt | uniq`

Common uniq Options

| Options | Description                                                                      |
| :-----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   -c    | Output a list of duplicate lines preceded by the number of times the line occurs |
|   -d    | Only output repeated lines, rather than unique lines                             |
|  -f n   | Ignore n leading fields in each line                                             |

## Slicing And Dicing

### cut

cut Selection Options

|    Option     | Description                                                                                                 |
| :-----------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -c char_list  | Extract the portion of the line defined by char_list                                                        |
| -f field_list | Extract one or more fields from the line as defined by field_list                                           |
| -d delim_char | When -f is specified, use delim_char as the field delimiting character. Default it's a single tab character |
| --complement  | Extract the entire line of text, except for those portions specified by -c and/or -f                        |

- cut is best used to extract text from files that are produced by other programs, rather than text directly typed by humans

  `cut -f 3 distros.txt`

  `cut -f 3 distros.txt | cut -c 7-10`

- Expanding Tabs

  Program expand can replace the tab characters within the file with the corresponding number of spaces

  `expand distros.txt | cut -c 23-`

  Specify a different field delimiter

  `cut -d ':' -f 1 /etc/passwd | head`

### paste

`paste distros-dates.txt distros-versions.txt`

### join

A join is an operation usually associated with relational databases where data from multiple tables with a shared key field is combined to form a desired result.

`join distros-key-names.txt distros-key-vernums.txt | head`

## Comparing Text

### comm

`comm file1.txt file2.txt`

Support options -n to suppress the columns

`comm -12 file1.txt file2.txt`

### diff

`diff file1.txt file2.txt`

diff Change Commands

### patch

The patch program is used to apply changes to text files.

`diff -Naur file1.txt file2.txt > patchfile.txt`

`patch < pathfile.txt`

## Editing On the Fly

### tr

The tr program is used to transliterate characters.

`echo "lowercase letters" | tr a-z A-Z`

`echo "lowercase letters" | tr [:lower:] A`

- To convert MS-DOS text files to Unix-style text:
- `tr -d '\r' < dos_file> unix_file`

  Squeeze repeated instances of a character (adjoining is needed)

  `echo "aaabbbccc" | tr -s ab`

### sed

The name sed is short for stream editor.

`echo "front" | sed 's/front/back/'`

The choice of the delimiter character is arbitrary

`echo "front" | sed 's_front_back_'`

Most commands in sed may be preceded by an address, which specifies which line(s) will be edited

`echo "front" | sed '1s/front/back/'`

sed Address Notation

|   Address    | Description                                                                                 |

|   /regexp/   | Lines matching a POSIX basic regular expression                                             |
| addr1, addr2 | A range of lines addr1 to addr2, inclusive                                                  |
|  first~step  | Match the line represented by the number first, then each subsequent line at step intervals |
|  addr1, +n   | Match addr1 and the following n lines                                                       |

1 i\
\
Linux Distribution Report\

s/\([0-9]\{2\}\)\/\([0-9]\{2\}\)\/\([0-9]\{4\}\)$/\3-\1-\2/

- People Who Like sed Also Like...
  awk and perl is used for larger tasks.

### aspell
