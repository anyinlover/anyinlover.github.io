# How to read a code project

Here I use the frame of reading book.

## Systematic skimming

After systematic skimming, we need to answer the following question:

1. What problem does this project want to solve?
2. What creative points do this project have?
3. What is the structure of this project?

Here is what we can do in 30min:

1. Read the README and skim the documents, if it links to some papers, read the abstracts.
2. Skim the project structure.
3. Run a demo if possible.
4. Use code analysis tools to see the codebase statistics.
5. Review dependencies and libraries.

## Superficial reading

After superficial reading, we need to answer the following question:

1. Which components are the important ones to solve the problems?
2. what coding style and design patterns does the project use?
3. What users' contracts does the project have?

Here is what we can do in 1hour:

1. Read all codes including annotations.
2. Read and analyze tests.
3. Read the code history.

## Analytical Reading

After superficial reading, we need to answer the following question:

1. What's the detailed design of the project?
2. How the codes solve the problem?
3. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the project?

Analytical Reading need more time, based the line nums of the project, maybe 1 day, 1 week or 1 month.

1. Read the original papers throughfully
2. Follow Data Flow
3. Use debugger to step the execution
4. Build class diagrams from database schema or base class
