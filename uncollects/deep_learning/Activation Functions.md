# Activation Functions

An activation function is a mathematical function that takes the weighted sum of inputs to an artificial neuron as input and produces an output signal based on its value. The main purpose of an activation function in a neural network is to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.
