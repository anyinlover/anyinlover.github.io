# 机器学习整体流程和挑战

## 流程

    A[Problem formulation] --> B[Problem formulation];
    B --> C[Train & tune models];
    C --> D[Deploy models];
    D --> E[Monitor];
    E --> B;
```

## 挑战

• Formulate problem: focus on the most impactful industrial problems
• Data: high-quality data is scarce, privacy issues
• Train models: ML models are more and more complex, data-hungry, expensive 
• Deploy models: heavy computation is not suitable for real-time inference
• Monitor: data distributions shifts, fairness issues
