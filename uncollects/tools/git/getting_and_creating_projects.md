# Getting and Creating Projects

## Creating from a local folder

To initialize a directory as a Git repository, use the following command:

```shell
git init
```

You can add all existing files to version control using the following commands:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Init project"
```

## Cloning from a remote repository like GitHub

```shell
git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
```
