## Continue Overview

Nowadays there are many paid and free AI code assistants in the market, Github Coilplot, Cursor, Zed, Continue... I choose Continue because it's opensource, configurable and available to all platforms.

Basically, [Continue](https://www.continue.dev/) is a VSCode or JetBrains plugin, with a custom LLM endpoint, we can use it to assist coding in serveral ways. It provides four ways of usage: Chat, Autocomplete, Edit and Actions.
