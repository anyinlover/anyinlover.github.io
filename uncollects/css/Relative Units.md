# Relative units

## Pixels

CSS supports several absolute length units, including pixel(px), mm, cm, Q, in., pt and pc.

A CSS pixel does not strictly equate to a monitor's pixel. I summary my [[Device Resolution]]

Generally 96px equals 1 physical inch, this can very on certain devices. In fact, 1 physical inch is less than 96px on my devices.

Edge browser default has a rounded corner, disable it by [instruction](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/all/edge-dev-browser-removes-leftright-margins/139ff422-9057-42ef-9b7d-b2afaf525e1b)

## Ems and rems

1 em means the font size of the current element.

Using ems can be convenient when setting properties like padding, height, width, or border-radius because these scale evenly with the element if it inherits different font sizes or if the user changes the font settings.

font-size ems are derived from the inherited font size.

For most browsers, the default font size is 16px.

When you define ems for font size and other properties, the browser first calculate the font size, then calculate the other values.

Rem is short for root em.

The recommend way of using units:

1. font size: rems
2. border: pixel
3. other measures like paddings, margins, border radius: ems or rems

## Viewport-relative units

- vh: One percent of the viewport height
- vw: One percent of the viewport width
- vmin: One percent of the smaller dimension, height or width
- vmax: One percent of the larger dimension, height or width

![small and large viewports](../../assets/image/viewports.png)

lvh, lvw, lvmin, lvmax, svh, svw, svmin, svmax

dvh, dvw, dvmin, dvmax: dynamic viewport, behave like small viewport when the viewport is small and like large viewport when the viewport is large.

We can use viewport units for font size with the help of `calc()` and `clamp()` functions.

## Unitless numbers

Following properties allow for unitless values:

1. line-height
2. z-index
3. font-weight
4. Any length unit with the value 0

The line-height property should use unitless value.
